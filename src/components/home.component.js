    				<h2>Abstract</h2>
    				<p>
The amount of Career Path Information available in the form of Resumes, University, College and School Alumina Data, Professional networks like Linkedin and Social Media networks etc can provide an effective guide to various stake holders(individuals, Educational Institutes,any Firm) who require career path information and guidance to progress their careers. We deploy effective methods like crowdsourcing for capturing career path data and then develop model for representing career path information, and deploy effective queries for information retrieval which covers large sections of the society. The Central issue we address with our model is, representation on career path data in the form graph, by defining an vertex and edge in a graph and showing its significance in career path. We describe vertex and edge using attributes which will be useful in addressing various types of queries posted by from various sections of society.

	<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
In any society, individuals settled in different careers posses a valuable carrier path information, which is a rich source of information content, provided we have effective methods of collecting, managing and providing access to other individuals who are in need of such information. In this work, we investigate the frameworks/protocols/algorithms collecting, storing, searching the information. In particular, we investigate the methods to model the career path information through graph structures and so that it will provide useful information to career path seekers. While our techniques are not specific to the career path information, we find the problems of modeling career path, storing and searching interesting. If we collect the career path information from a large set of individuals, it will be a big graph with enormous complexity, and it will continue to expand at a phenomenal rate with addition of more career paths. Moreover, it can be viewed as an intricate form of populist graph, in which millions of on-line participants, with diverse and often conflicting goals, are continuously creating career path content. Thus, while individuals can contribute their own career paths at the individual level, the combined graph of all career paths can be a source of very valuable, interesting and useful information which will benefit millions of individuals. Our work originates in the problem of modeling, storing and searching a collection of career paths of millions of individuals in the society, which we could define roughly as the process of searching relevant career paths or the portion of career paths that are relevant to a given career path query. The quality of a search results necessarily require the collection of quality career path data. We begin from the observation that there is no comprehensive system or approach exists to collect career path information of diverse individuals in a cross section of society. So, developing a model to collect and store career path information and an algorithm to search the relevant career path information is an interesting research problem and will impact lives of individuals. In particular, consider that current systems of career path providers such as LinkedIn , which typically collect the resumes from only professionals and provide information/job recommendations to the other professions who require such information. There are approach to extract interesting information from resumes such as skills , store them as a collection of massive skill graph so that information for next skill can be extracted. Although there would be considerable utility in such frameworks, they are not versatile and can not be employed to collect and maintain career path information from diverse individuals of all ages and occupations in the society. Clearly the existing approaches lack the requires scope. A part from searching, the main research issue is the modeling of a career path. That is, how to model a career path so that it can capture the career path journey of millions of individuals? Specifically, how to model a node and how to model an edge between two nodes. Overview - Our approach to model career paths is meant to have a global nature: We wish to develop a versatile model which can be used to collect career path information of any individual. Also, we also develop a solution to the problem of career path database management and filtering large volumes of information, since the entire set of career paths relevant to a typical career path query can have a size in the millions.
